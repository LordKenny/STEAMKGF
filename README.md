#🔑 Steam Key Generator and Verifier 🎮

This project allows you to generate and verify Steam keys using Python. It leverages the `requests`, `random`, `art`, and `colorama` packages to create a fun and interactive key generation experience. The generated keys are checked for validity using the Steam API and categorized as valid, invalid, or encountering errors.

✨ Features:
- Continuous key generation at a rate of {NUM_KEYS_PER_SECOND} keys per second ⚡️
- Visual and colorful display of key validation results 🌈
- Integration of ASCII art for a visually appealing welcome banner 🌟
- Saving of valid keys to an "output.txt" file 📝
- Steam API key persistence for convenient usage 🔑

To get started, make sure to have the required packages installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, execute the script and enter your Steam API key when prompted. Press Enter to begin the key generation process.

The generated keys will be checked against the Steam API, and the validation results will be displayed with corresponding colors. Valid keys will be saved to the "output.txt" file for future reference.

Feel free to explore, run, and modify this project to suit your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy key generation! 🚀
